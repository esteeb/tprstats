\title{Confidence Intervals for Coefficients (Cross Section Data)}
\usage{
CIcoefH(linmod, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{linmod}{The regression for which confidence intervals of coefficients are to be calculated. An object of class "lm" or one that can be coerced to that class.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level. Defaults to 0.05.}
}
\description{
Calculates confidence intervals for coefficients of a regression model. The calculation corrects for possible presence of heteroskedasticity using the method developed by White. This method is appropriate for cross-section data.
